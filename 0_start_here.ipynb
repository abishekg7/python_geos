    "A short course offered by Texas A&M High Performance Research Computing in Fall 2021. Short course home page: \n",
    "https://hprc.tamu.edu/training/python_geo.html\n",
    "\n",
    "This short course will introduce some basic Python packages relevant to Geoscientific data analysis. We will introduce the Pangeo collection of python-based utilities to process and visualize output from General Circulation Models (GCMs). Using model output in the netCDF format, we will look at how to generate climatology and time-averages, visualize quantities, resample data, take spatial derivatives, perform interpolations in the vertical coordinates, and how to regrid unstructured grid data to a regular grid. We will also discuss obtaining Buoy and Satellite data using Siphon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of this course are based on the excellent training materials offered by the xarray, dask, and Pangeo communities. See `Useful links` below. \n",
